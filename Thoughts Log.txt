This will just record thoughts I have while constructing the machine or make plans.

Instruction Decoder: Aug. 21, 2022
Building the Instruction Decoder has been immensely complicated, since it has to be compact, fast, 
and has tight constraints for where it can fit.
The first challenge has been creating the logic that will execute my L-RRR-S-FFF instruction format.
I have basically two different tables that need to be addressed:
One uses RRRS, the other uses SFFF.
The S-Bit has to be wired into both of these at the same time, but the arrangement I planned on Building
groups them into 4 tables that all get stacked on top of each other.
Even More complicated though, was the fact that when FFF == 000, then RRRS is used for the function selection.
So this means that part of the Address-Decoding in the Tables actually depends on the chosen address.

Trying to wire this all together in a way that avoids adding any un-necessary delays was also difficult.
I ended up fusing low-delay Blocking-Gates with the places that Repeaters were actually required to disable 
the Tables that are not being used.

And to think my primary concern was with laying out the Control Bits!!!

I've finally managed to build the Instruction Decoder now, or at least part of it.  The Decoding part.
7 bits of input now uniquely and reliably selects 30 different data locations.  Hurray!!
